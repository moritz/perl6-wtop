Well-Thought-Out practises for Perl 6.

Just like PBP, but for Perl 6, but more <add management speak here>.

If you want to add a rule or advise here, please make sure to add yourself as
a champion. A champion is somebody who is in favor of a rule, and will spend
countless hours on IRC or mailing list defending them against clueless people.

Pratices that have not yet been discussed should go into F<rfc.pod>

Well, not quite like that, but they should at least be able to explain *why*
that rule makes sense.
